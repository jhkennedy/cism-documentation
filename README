Notes on building documentation for CISM
----------------------------------------
MJH March 2014

* One manual step is required to build the documentation: Update the value of "top_srcdir" near the top of the Makefile to point to the location of trunk directory of the repo.

* A number of utilities/programs may need to be manually specified at the top of the Makefile.  The current values work for me on my Mac, but minor adjustments may be needed by others.

* The version number of the code needs to be manually updated by editing the file ./common/version.tex

* The external packages in 'ext' are not included in the documentation for now.  This was set by adding a new file "selected_ext.tex" with values of False set in it.  This file was supposed to be generated by autotools from selected_ext.tex.in.
Note that the extensions have been deleted from the trunk as of 6/12/14 so these contents are no longer needed, strictly speaking.  

* Currently all figure files must be in .eps format.  
[If we switch from 'latex' to 'pdflatex' then we could have all of the figures in pdf and/or png format.  This would also simplify the build process as the extra step of converting between dvi to pdf would not be needed.  However, there may be other issues that crop up in the conversion so some this may not be trivial to do.]

To convert a png to eps, one can do:
> convert foo.png foo.eps
